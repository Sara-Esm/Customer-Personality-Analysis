# Customer Personality Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing customer personalities using various data science techniques. The project covers customer segmentation, clustering, and association rule mining to derive insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
    - Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `dataprep.eda`.
    - Creation of new features to define customer personalities.

2. **Customer Clustering**
    - Utilization of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering customers into segments.
    - Visualization of customer clustering using 3D scatter plots.

3. **Data Preparation for Customer Personality Analysis**
    - Segmentation of customers based on age, income, seniority, and product consumption.

4. **Apriori Algorithm**
    - Application of the Apriori algorithm to identify associations in customer behaviour.
    - Analysis of the biggest consumers of specific products.
